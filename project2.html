      <h2>Project Overview / Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This project analyzes <strong>AKO Bakery‚Äôs performance between February and June 2024</strong> using Microsoft Excel. 
        The goal was to understand monthly sales trends, identify top-performing sales channels, measure profit fluctuations, 
        and forecast how price adjustments (‚Ç¶1,500 and ‚Ç¶1,800) could impact revenue and profitability.

    <!-- 2. Business Background -->
    <section>
      <h2>Business Background</h2>
      <p>
        AKO Bakery is a growing bakery that produces and distributes bread through three main channels ‚Äî retailers, AREPO wholesalers, 
        and walk-in customers. Between February and June 2024, the bakery experienced fluctuating performance across sales, cost, 
        and profitability. Leadership needed a data-driven analysis to identify which channels drive sales, where losses occur, 
        and how pricing adjustments could improve profits.
      </p>

      </ul>
    </section>

        <li><strong>Profit Margin:</strong> Portion of sales revenue retained as profit after costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Sales Growth:</strong> Percentage increase in sales compared to the previous month.</li>
        <li><strong>SP (Selling Price):</strong> Price per bread loaf for the month.</li>

      <p>üìä The monthly analysis below highlights key patterns in volume, sales, and profit.</p>
      <img src="images2/kpis.PNG" alt="Key Metrics and Performance Highlights">

        <li><strong>February:</strong> Lowest sales and volume but second most profitable month due to low production cost.</li>
        <li><strong>March:</strong> Most profitable month after increasing price to ‚Ç¶1,300; bulk order significantly boosted profit.</li>
        <li><strong>April:</strong> Sharp decline in all metrics; 48% of sales made below cost of ‚Ç¶1,234, resulting in losses.</li>
        <li><strong>May:</strong> Revenue dropped slightly due to the economic downturn, but profit improved.</li>
        <li><strong>June:</strong> Recovered with an increase in all metrics, ranking second in total revenue and profit.</li>

    <!-- 6. Sales Channel -->
    <section>
      <h2>Sales Channel Performance</h2>
      <p>
        Retailers were the key driver of growth, contributing 69% of total sales with a 41% average growth rate. 
        AREPO contributed 24% but showed a consistent month-on-month decline (-2% average). 
        Walk-in customers represented the smallest share (7%) but displayed a healthy 31% average growth.

    <!-- 7. Predictive Analysis -->
    <section>
      <h2>Predictive Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Predictive models were created for three pricing scenarios using ‚Ç¶1,500 and ‚Ç¶1,800 as new price points:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neutral Case:</strong> All other factors remain constant; moderate profit increase.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimistic Case:</strong> Price increase with stable customer demand; highest projected profit.</li>
        <li><strong>Pessimistic Case:</strong> Slight decline in volume due to price sensitivity but profit still improved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Based on analysis, setting the retail price at ‚Ç¶1,500 and offering retailers a ‚Ç¶1,450 discount per loaf 
        would maximize profit without losing market share.
